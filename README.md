#TWO-FACTOR_AUTHENTICATION

Overview of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
2FA adds an extra layer of security to authentication systems. Instead of relying solely on a username and password, 2FA requires a second form of verificationâ€”often a time-based one-time password (TOTP) generated by an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator).

Why Use Speakeasy?
Speakeasy is a popular Node.js library for generating and verifying TOTP codes. It adheres to the Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) algorithm and the HMAC-based One-Time Password (HOTP) algorithm, making it ideal for implementing 2FA.
